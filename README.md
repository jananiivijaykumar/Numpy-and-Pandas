# Numpy-and-Pandas
This project demonstrates the use of NumPy and Pandas for data analysis and manipulation. NumPy provides powerful tools for numerical computations, while Pandas offers flexible data structures like DataFrames for handling structured datasets. Together, they form the backbone of data science in Python.
